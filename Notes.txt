1. Problem with the standard approach ?
	- Blocking operation
	- Suppose in a Controller you are taking userId, and using that userId to fetch USER and USERPreferences objects.
	- So first you get User, THEN you get UserPreferences. These are independent operations, they could process parallely.
	- THEN you are setting UserPreference in the User object and returning the User. 
	- So the thread which processes your request is kept busy until you method is complete i.e User is returned.

2. One solution to this problem is CompletableFuture.
	- using this we can parallelly fetch the 2 entities, but the Thread would still be stuck, becasue we HAVE to return a User.
	- And the CompletableFuture API is horrible, for me atleast.

3. There comes Reactive Programming.
	Now before going into reactive-programming, make sure you are familiar with Java 8 Streams API. Because these two are very 
	similar.

4. After that, you need to know about Observer and Iterator Design Patterns.
	-Iterator: Regardless of the Container which is storing the elements, you'll just get the Iterator Implementation, and using
			next(), you can access all the elements.
	
	-Observer: When there is going be data coming from somewhere, but you cannot be there to process it when the data arrives,
 			so you send an Observer which observers when the data arrives and does something. (this is usually a method)

5. Similarties between Iterator and Observer design patterns:

    There is something very similar between these 2 design patterns:
        -In Iterator you are "PULLING" data from the source.
        -In Observer you the source is "PUSHING" data.
        -That is why, we revised streams api. Because code wise reactive programming is quite similar to streams api.

6. You can get a List from the flux or an Item from Mono by blocking it.

7. When a Flux is emitting event, it will emit a complete event when the source does not have any more values. OR
    It can emit an error event, in case of some error. We can easily handle either situation in the subscribe() method.

8. Blocking Duration:
    When we are blocking a Mono to get the String out of it, we can specify the duration of the block, in case the Mono is unresponsive.
    So we code will be blocked for that particular duration, if data is received well and good, if not it will throw an IllegalStateException.

9. Blocking somewhere:
    If ms-1 calls a controller on ms-2 expecting a User object, it need user right, so there has to be blocking somewhere right.
    Although we are returning a Mono, but somewhere it has to get the User from the Mono. So the thing is that, when a Controller returns
    a Mono, someone has to subscribe to the Mono to get the User; hence the controller leaves it up to the Framework/Server(Netty) to do that.

10. Operators:
    Consider a scenario where a controller after getting a Mono<User> from the service, need to do certain operations on it.
    This is where operators come into picture. Just like we have operators on a Collection Stream, we also have the same on Flux and Mono.
    For Eg:
            public Mono<User> getUser(String id) {
                Mono<User> monoUser = service.getUserMono(id);

                return monoUser.filter(user-> user.isActive == true);   //returns a Mono
            }

    Hence, like "filter()" there are multiple operations we can perform. So the result itself is a Mono which is given to Framework or the Server.
	
11. Error is a terminal event. Terminal means the consumer stops consuming. Calls onError() method of the subscriber. Catching error in subscribe is almost like a "catch"
		-We can continue even if an error occurs using "onErrorContinue()" method. 
		-onErrorResume will stop the current flux and return new flux, it's like a fallback
		-doFinally() is like a "finally" block, where depending on the type of signal we can perform certain actions. 
			Try running it with normal "intNumbersFlux" to understand better. It will run after subscribe()
