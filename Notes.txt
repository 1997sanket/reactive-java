1. Problem with the standard approach ?
	- Blocking operation
	- Suppose in a Controller you are taking userId, and using that userId to fetch USER and USERPreferences objects.
	- So first you get User, THEN you get UserPreferences. These are independent operations, they could process parallely.
	- THEN you are setting UserPreference in the User object and returning the User. 
	- So the thread which processes your request is kept busy until you method is complete i.e User is returned.

2. One solution to this problem is CompletableFuture.
	- using this we can parallelly fetch the 2 entities, but the Thread would still be stuck, becasue we HAVE to return a User.
	- And the CompletableFuture API is horrible, for me atleast.

3. There comes Reactive Programming.
	Now before going into reactive-programming, make sure you are familiar with Java 8 Streams API. Because these two are very 
	similar.

4. After that, you need to know about Observer and Iterator Design Patterns.
	-Iterator: Regardless of the Container which is storing the elements, you'll just get the Iterator Implementation, and using
			next(), you can access all the elements.
	
	-Obserevr: When there is going be data coming from somewhere, but you cannot be there to process it when the data arrives,
 			so you send an Observer which observers when the data arrives and does something. (this is usually a method)

5. There is something very similar between these 2 design patterns:
	-In Iterator you are "PULLING" data from the source.
	-In Observer you the source is "PUSHING" data.
	-That is why, we revised streams api. Because code wise reactive programming is quite similar to streams api.

6. When we subscribe on the flux and get data one by one in a non blocking way, if our main thread ends, we won't get the data anymore. We dont need to know the internal implementation.

7. We are getting data in a flux one by one, we can convert it to a stream, but that will be blocking operation, flow wont go ahead
	till all the data is taken in to the List (checkout Exercise 3).
